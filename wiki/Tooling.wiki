#summary Taxonomy of the elements of the devops tool-chain

= Introduction =

The foundation of the devops tool-chain is the set tools themselves. Of particular interest is establishing a tool-chain taxonomy. What categories of tools are there? How do they correlate to the [SdlcPhases SDLC]? How are they ordered? Which are closely integrated with one-another, roughly compatible, or down-right disjoint? Which [QualitativeMetrics qualities] does each tool embody? Where does it fall short? What [Artifacts artifacts] do they produce?

This section presents a tabular taxonomy of Open Source tooling.
