#summary DevOps best practices

  * Collaboration and involvement early in the life cycle

  * Configuration is code and separated from app code as artifact

  * Operational concerns as non-func throughout the life cycle

  * Consistent tooling between the dev ops teams

  * Using packaging as release vehicle

  * Abstracted administration

  * Automated build and release

  * Modeled life cycles that drive tool behavior (eg versioned SDLCs)

  * Automated infrastructure/system provisioning

  * Audited release tracing  (requirements to operation)

  * Ops tooling falls under the same SDLC as the bizapp
