#summary Introduction to "DevOps" as a concept

= What is DevOps? =

The term "DevOps" is fairly new and therefore does not yet have a canonical definition. Some believe it is a label applied to a set of best practices used for years in high performing IT organizations. Others believe it is a methodology and associated tooling to automate end-to-end software development life cycle. It certainly has the goal to mitigate the classic disconnect between the development and operations teams through better alignment. 

Actually, the term is still so new it is interesting to search for the term on the web to see what is rising to the top: [http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=what+is+devops&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8 Google Search]

In classic Wiki style, the devops-toolchain community can establish their own definition, or perhaps criteria to designate something as "DevOps".
